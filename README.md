HELLO BIKO

Biko Park

_______________________

Project idea and overview:

- "Biko Park" is a spin-off of the indie game "Pico Park" with a bunch of special twists.

- The game is designed as a couch co-op game for four players where you need immense amounts of teamwork, strategizing and planning to complete (it is a difficult game in nature).

- Each player is assigned a role that is connected to their ability, blend the abilities together using teamwork and you'll solve the puzzles within the game.

- Play and advance through 10 different levels by finding the key and unlocking the door at the end of each level.

- If one player dies, the level resets. So be ready for alot of strategizing, documenting traps and planning to finish the game.

- The game has 4-5 hours of gameplay, depending on the synergy between the players.

		Hard (hints are turned off with the most amount of traps and fake floors)

- 2 different GAMEMODES:

	Progression mode
	Freeplay mode


- Progression Mode:
		The next level can only be unlocked if the previous is completed. In the mode selection menu, the players get to choose between starting a new game or continuing a saved game. If the players choose a new game they are redirected to the difficulty select menu where they can choose the difficulty of their journey.


- Freeplay Mode:
		The players get to choose which level they want to play without having to finish any previous level, with a custom freeplay difficulty.


- A functional SAVE FILE that stores which difficulty the players selected and the level they stopped at in progression mode so they can hop back into the fun whenever they like without losing their progress.

		Level 5 (Watch Your Step): This level is filled with traps and fake floors.

		Level 6 (Find The Button): There is a secret invisible button to open the end of the level. Can you find it?

		Level 7 (Run): A race against time, the camera is moving, don't get caught outside.

		Level 8 (No Touching!): If any player touches the other, they die. Try to finish the level without touching any of your friends.

		Level 9 (Sacrifice): figure out who should take the key, 4 players go in, only one leaves.

		Level 10 (The Escape): A boss type level with 4 stages (waves).

			Wave 1: lasers appear and move around the level.

			Wave 2: Poison potions fall from the sky and leave a lingering effect that kills the players.

			Wave 3: Blocks fall from the sky and only the builder can push them away and save everyone.
